# Advancing Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Psychosocial Disability Research through Large Language Models and Computational Text Mining

<p align="justify">Psychosocial rehabilitation and mental disability research has been a longstanding topic in healthcare, demanding continuous exploration and analysis to enhance patient and clinical outcomes. As the prevalence of psychosocial rehabilitation and mental disability research continues to attract scholarly attention, a large column of scientific articles are being published in the literature where these publications offer profound insights into diagnostics, preventative measures, treatment strategies, and epidemiological factors. Computational text mining as a sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI) can make a big difference in accurately analyzing the current extensive collection of scientific articles on time, assisting individual scientists in understanding mental disabilities better, and improving how we care for people with these challenges. Leveraging the vast repository of scientific literature available on PubMed, this study employs advanced text mining strategies, including word embeddings and large language models (LLMs) to extract valuable insights, automatically catalyzing research in mental health. Additionally, it aims to significantly enhance the scientific communityâ€™s knowledge by creating an extensive textual dataset and advanced computational text mining strategies to explore current trends in psychosocial rehabilitation and mental disability research.</p>

### Value of the Data:
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Research Advancement:</strong> The HexAI-TJAtxt dataset provides a comprehensive collection of scientific abstracts related to total joint arthroplasty, assisting researchers, clinicians, health informaticians, and physicians to explore the upmost body of knowledge in the field and identify research gaps and areas.</p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Extensive Coverage:</strong> The current textual dataset comprises over 61,936 scientific abstracts from PubMed, providing a comprehensive collection of research on total joint arthroplasty (TJA) from the year 2000 to 2022, with bi-monthly updates from new abstracts that will be published at PubMed.</p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Invaluable Information:</strong> Individual scientists from different disciplines will delve into this dataset, gaining new insights and enhance their understanding of joint diseases, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and clinical outcomes in TJA. </p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Open Access for Scientific Research:</strong> Making this dataset publicly and freely available will foster open scientific research in the field of TJA.</p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Evidence-Based Medicine</strong> The HexAI-TJAtxt empowers researchers and clinicians to make evidence-based decisions, facilitating literature reviews, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews related to TJA. </p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Interdisciplinary Research:</strong> The HexAI-TJAtxt dataset encourages collaboration and knowledge exchange between researchers from different disciplines. Orthopedic surgeons, geneticists, epidemiologists, data scientists, AI scientists, and other experts can explore the dataset together, fostering interdisciplinary research and facilitating a holistic understanding of TJA. </p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Rapid Text Analytics:</strong> The HexAI-TJAtxt dataset offers an opportunity for computational text analytics on a large-scale scientific literature. Researchers can employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning algorithms, and other computational tools to extract valuable insights, discover patterns, and identify novel associations within the dataset, in a timely fashion. </p>
+ <p align="justify"><strong>Future Dataset Expansion:</strong> The dataset will serve as a foundational data source for future dataset expansions, allowing for the inclusion of additional articles and updates to ensure the dataset remains up-to-date and representative of the research landscape in total joint arthroplasty. </p>

### The proposed pipeline to build the HexAI-TJAtxt textual dataset:
